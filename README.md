## Introduction

Git is a powerful version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage code effectively. This guide aims to provide a step-by-step approach to learning Git, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is designed to efficiently handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and data integrity. Git is widely used in the software development industry and beyond, enabling teams to work collaboratively and maintain a history of changes made to the codebase.

## Why Git?

Git offers several advantages, including:

- **Distributed Development:** Developers can work on their local copies of a project and later synchronize changes with others.

- **Branching:** Git allows for easy creation and management of branches, enabling parallel development and experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

- **History Tracking:** Git maintains a complete history of changes, making it easy to revert to a previous state or analyze the evolution of the project.

- **Collaboration:** With features like forking, pull requests, and code reviews, Git facilitates efficient collaboration among developers.

## How Git Works

Git works by creating snapshots of changes to files over time. It uses a branching model to manage different lines of development and allows for efficient merging of changes. The distributed nature of Git means that each developer has a complete copy of the repository, providing redundancy and resilience.

## Getting Started
